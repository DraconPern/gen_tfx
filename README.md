TransparentFX winamp plugin
===========================

TransparentFX is a plugin for Winamp2 to enable window alpha blending.  This was around the time frame of Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  It's 2015, and I have decided to open source the plugin. It is written in C++.

Cheeky old description
----------------------
TransparentFX enables transparent effects for Winamp2 that puts Winamp3’s native alpha blending to shame by including fading and more customization. It is a general purpose plug-in that reacts to a windows’s active, mouseover, and inactive states. It barley uses any system resources and you can tailor the settings to limit cpu usage. Written in C++ so it doesn’t have all that VB baggage.
